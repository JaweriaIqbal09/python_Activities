# 🐍 Python Activities from CIS Hackathon

Welcome to **python_activities** — a collection of Python tasks and challenges I've tackled as part of the CIS Hackathon Standard Competition. Each activity represents a step in my learning journey, from early scripts to more advanced problem-solving.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A record of my progress during the Hackathon
- A reflection of the skills I’ve built and the bugs I’ve battled
- An honest snapshot of code that’s functional but still evolving

## 📁 What You'll Find

- 🧠 Logic puzzles and problem-solving exercises  
- 📊 Data parsing and handling tasks  
- 🎮 Game-inspired challenges and experiments  
- 🛠 Scripts showcasing core Python concepts  

Some code may be rough or incomplete—it's all part of the process!

## 🚀 Tech Used

- Python 3.11
- Standard Python libraries

## 💬 Final Thoughts

These activities aren’t polished projects—they’re learning artifacts. I’m proud of every error fixed, every idea tested, and every improvement made.

Feel free to explore, learn, or even offer suggestions if you spot something I can improve. Growth thrives on feedback!
